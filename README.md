#Applied Interactive Music

## About
Applied Interactive Music is an Android app that plays dynamic music based on the user's GPS location.
The concept was inspired by interactive video game music which responds to a player's actions and movement
in the virtual game environment.

The ambitious vision that I pictured working towards was a tool that a composer might use to write an
interactive soundtrack for their neighbourhood, their city, their favourite park, or some other real
world environment. Transitions between multiple pieces of music could take place upon entering a building,
reaching the top of a hill, moving between distinct neighbourhoods with different visual characteristics, etc.
Each piece of music could be made interactive so as to add/remove layers as the user climbed in elevation (for
example, ascending a building's floors) or crossed distance (for example, walking from one end of a building
to the other). Sections of a single piece of music could be shuffled randomly or based on GPS data.

For this prototype, I limited the scope to a single geographic region: The University of Victoria's quadrangle
and a specific piece of interactive music that I wrote inspired by that region. However, the app could easily be
extended in the future to play interactive compositions inspired by other real world locations.

## Demo Video

This video includes a walkthrough of the design, musical components, Wwise project, Unity project, and
C# scripts, followed by a demo of the product. For those curious, I recommend this video as an alternative
to cloning the repo and trying to run the Unity project yourself. The reason for this is that the app
requires a complex Wwise and Unity configuration and requires the user to be on-site at the University of
Victoria.
